 *
 * @typedef Unsafe
 *   Schema that defines when a character cannot occur.
 * @property {string} character
 *   Single unsafe character.
 * @property {ConstructName | Array<ConstructName> | null | undefined} [inConstruct]
 *   Constructs where this is bad.
 * @property {ConstructName | Array<ConstructName> | null | undefined} [notInConstruct]
 *   Constructs where this is fine again.
 * @property {string | null | undefined} [before]
 *   `character` is bad when this is before it (cannot be used together with
 *   `atBreak`).
 * @property {string | null | undefined} [after]
 *   `character` is bad when this is after it.
 * @property {boolean | null | undefined} [atBreak]
 *   `character` is bad at a break (cannot be used together with `before`).
 * @property {RegExp | null | undefined} [_compiled]
 *   The unsafe pattern (this whole object) compiled as a regex.
 *
 *   This is internal and must not be defined.
 *
 * @typedef Options
 *   Configuration (optional).
 * @property {'-' | '*' | '+' | null | undefined} [bullet='*']
 *   Marker to use for bullets of items in unordered lists.
 * @property {'-' | '*' | '+' | null | undefined} [bulletOther]
 *   Marker to use in certain cases where the primary bullet doesn‚Äôt work.
 *
 *   There are three cases where the primary bullet cannot be used:
 *
 *   *   When three list items are on their own, the last one is empty, and
 *       `bullet` is also a valid `rule`: `* - +`.
 *       This would turn into a thematic break if serialized with three primary
 *       bullets.
 *       As this is an edge case unlikely to appear in normal markdown, the
 *       last list item will be given a different bullet.
 *   *   When a thematic break is the first child of one of the list items, and
 *       `bullet` is the same character as `rule`: `- ***`.
 *       This would turn into a single thematic break if serialized with
 *       primary bullets.
 *       As this is an edge case unlikely to appear in normal markdown this
 *       markup is always fixed, even if `bulletOther` is not passed
 *   *   When two unordered lists appear next to each other: `* a\n- b`.
 *       CommonMark sees different bullets as different lists, but several
 *       markdown parsers parse it as one list.
 *       To solve for both, we instead inject an empty comment between the two
 *       lists: `* a\n<!---->\n* b`, but if `bulletOther` is given explicitly,
 *       it will be used instead
 * @property {'.' | ')' | null | undefined} [bulletOrdered='.']
 *   Marker to use for bullets of items in ordered lists.
 * @property {'.' | ')' | null | undefined} [bulletOrderedOther]
 *   Marker to use in certain cases where the primary bullet for ordered items
 *   doesn‚Äôt work.
 *
 *   There is one case where the primary bullet for ordered items cannot be used:
 *
 *   *   When two ordered lists appear next to each other: `1. a\n2) b`.
 *       CommonMark added support for `)` as a marker, but other markdown
 *       parsers do not support it.
 *       To solve for both, we instead inject an empty comment between the two
 *       lists: `1. a\n<!---->\n1. b`, but if `bulletOrderedOther` is given
 *       explicitly, it will be used instead
 * @property {boolean | null | undefined} [closeAtx=false]
 *   Whether to add the same number of number signs (`#`) at the end of an ATX
 *   heading as the opening sequence.
 * @property {'_' | '*' | null | undefined} [emphasis='*']
 *   Marker to use for emphasis.
 * @property {'~' | '`' | null | undefined} [fence='`']
 *   Marker to use for fenced code.
 * @property {boolean | null | undefined} [fences=false]
 *   Whether to use fenced code always.
 *
 *   The default is to use fenced code if there is a language defined, if the
 *   code is empty, or if it starts or ends in blank lines.
 * @property {boolean | null | undefined} [incrementListMarker=true]
 *   Whether to increment the counter of ordered lists items.
 * @property {'tab' | 'one' | 'mixed' | null | undefined} [listItemIndent='tab']
 *   How to indent the content of list items.
 *
 *   Either with the size of the bullet plus one space (when `'one'`), a tab
 *   stop (`'tab'`), or depending on the item and its parent list (`'mixed'`,
 *   uses `'one'` if the item and list are tight and `'tab'` otherwise).
 * @property {'"' | "'" | null | undefined} [quote='"']
 *   Marker to use for titles.
 * @property {boolean | null | undefined} [resourceLink=false]
 *   Whether to always use resource links.
 *
 *   The default is to use autolinks (`<https://example.com>`) when possible
 *   and resource links (`[text](url)`) otherwise.
 * @property {'-' | '_' | '*' | null | undefined} [rule='*']
 *   Marker to use for thematic breaks.
 * @property {number | null | undefined} [ruleRepetition=3]
 *   Number of markers to use for thematic breaks.
 * @property {boolean | null | undefined} [ruleSpaces=false]
 *   Whether to add spaces between markers in thematic breaks.
 * @property {boolean | null | undefined} [setext=false]
 *   Whether to use setext headings when possible.
 *
 *   The default is to always use ATX headings (`# heading`) instead of setext
 *   headings (`heading\n=======`).
 *   Setext headings cannot be used for empty headings or headings with a rank
 *   of three or more.
 * @property {'_' | '*' | null | undefined} [strong='*']
 *   Marker to use for strong.
 * @property {boolean | null | undefined} [tightDefinitions=false]
 *   Whether to join definitions without a blank line.
 *
 *   The default is to add blank lines between any flow (‚Äúblock‚Äù) construct.
 *   Turning this option on is a shortcut for a join function like so:
 *
 *   ```js
 *   function joinTightDefinitions(left, right) {
 *     if (left.type === 'definition' && right.type === 'definition') {
 *       return 0
 *     }
 *   }
 *   ```
 * @property {Handlers | null | undefined} [handlers={}]
 *   Handle particular nodes.
 *
 *   Each key is a node type, each value its corresponding handler.
 * @property {Array<Join> | null | undefined} [join=[]]
 *   How to join blocks.
 * @property {Array<Unsafe> | null | undefined} [unsafe=[]]
 *   Schemas that define when characters cannot occur.
 * @property {Array<Options> | null | undefined} [extensions=[]]
 *   List of extensions to include.
 *
 *   Each `ToMarkdownExtension` is an object with the same interface as
 *   `Options` here.
